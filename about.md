<h2>Motivation and goals:</h2>
While it may be a long time before all the vehicles on our roadways are completely automated (if ever), it is likely that in the near future there will be an increasing number of autonomous (or partially autonomous) vehicles. These vehicles will likely drive somewhat differently than human drivers, and will thus influence the traffic dynamics.  The goal of this project is to identify the extent to which a small number of autonomous vehicles in the traffic flow (e.g., 5&#37; of vehicles) are able to alter the traffic dynamics and mitigate adverse emergent phenomena such as phantom traffic jams. The work includes both theoretical contributions on traffic stability as well as extensive experimental work demonstrating the ability of a single autonomous vehicle in a flow of 20 human-piloted vehicles to completely eliminate traffic instabilities reducing overall fuel consumption by nearly 40&#37;.
